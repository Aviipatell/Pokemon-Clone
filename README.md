# Java Pokemon Game Clone

Created a personalized version of the infamous Nintendo Pokemon Games (Pokemon Black/White, Pokemon Black/White 2, etc) through Java and its Graphical User Interface. A few features included were:
- The ability to pick and choose your character (2 male options and 1 female option as reminiscent of the original games).
- The ability to choose your own customizable party of 3 pokemon form the given 6 options.
- The ability to move your character using the keyboard arrow keys on a map similiar to the ones seen in the offical games.
- The ability to battle up to 5 other pokemon trainers and create strategies to beat them considering type advantage and disadvantages. 
- The ability to heal your pokemon using Super Potions and Hyper Potions (as in the original games).
- The ability to store and record your score and display a leaderboard at the end of it.

# Objective: 

The main objective of the game is to beat as many trainers as possible and enter the house at the end to receive the highest score possible. You do not neccessary have to beat all of the trainers to enable you to enter the house. If you want, you can go to the house without battling a single player. However, you score is based on the number of players you defeat (maximum of 5), and the condition (health) of your pokemons when you finally enter the house. Entering the house right away without battling any players will mean your score will be based soley upon the unaltered conditions of your pokemon which won't be nearly enough to win and rank on the leaderboards. Furthermore, if you were to lose to a trainer with all your pokemon having fainted, your score will be soley based upon the number of players you defeated (since all of your pokemons healths would be zero). Also note that the trainer difficulties increase for every trainer you defeat, making the later trainers even harder to defeat. Come up with strategies that will let you beat the most amount of players while also keeping your pokemon in a great condition to achieve the highest possible score and potentially be number 1 - the pokemon master!
